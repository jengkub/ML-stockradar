      "<p><strong>นายกิจพล ไพรไพศาลกิจ</strong> ผู้อำนวยการฝ่ายวิเคราะห์และนักกลยุทธ์ <strong>บล.ยูโอบี เคย์เฮียน (ประเทศไทย)</strong> กล่าวว่าตลาดหุ้นไทยปรับตัวลงไปในทิศทางเดียวกับตลาดหุ้นเอเชียหลังจากตลาดหุ้นยุโรปเปิดทำการปรับตัวลดลง โดยเฉพาะหุ้นแบงก์ร่วงแรง เครดิตสวิส ดิ่งลง 62% และหุ้น UBS ร่วง 14% ส่วนหุ้นแบงก์อื่นๆ ก็ปรับตัวลงไป 5-6%</p>\n",
      "<p>โดยสาเหตุหลักมาจากการ write off ตราสารหนี้ของธนาคารเครดิตสวิส ซึ่งเป็นตราสารหนี้ที่สามารถแปลงหนี้เป็นหุ้น และนับเป็นเงินกองทุนขั้นที่ 1 (Additional 1:AT1) มูลค่า 1.73 หมื่นล้านเหรียญสหรัฐถูกตัดเป็นศูนย์ และยังมีธนาคารอื่นในยุโรปที่มีตราสารหนี้ประเภทนี้ เนื่องจากนักลงทุนกลัวว่าจะเป็นปัญหากลายเป็นโดมิโนจากความเสี่ยงในการถือตราสารหนี้ AT1 ส่งผลให้ช่วงบ่ายตลาดหุ้นยุโรปผันผวน และส่งผลมาถึงตลาดเอเชียเช่นกัน</p>\n",
      "<p>อย่างไรก็ตาม ตลาดหุ้นไทยยังมีปัจจัยบวกเรื่องยุบสภา ทำให้จากที่ดัชนีลงไปลึกถึง 20 จุดหลังจากประกาศยุบสภาจึงเด้งขึ้นมาลดช่วงลบไปได้บ้าง</p>\n",
      "<p>สำหรับแนวโน้มในวันพรุ่งนี้ คาดว่าตลาดยังมีความผันผวนอยู่ แต่มองว่าจะเป็นภาพระยะสั้นกรณีที่ตราสารหนี้กลับมามีความเสี่ยงมากกว่าหุ้น แต่เชื่อว่าสุดท้ายเมื่อมีความชัดเจนมากขึ้น และผลการประชุมธนาคารกลางสหรัฐ (เฟด) ในวันที่ 21-22 มี.ค.66 น่าจะทำให้ความกังวลทิศทางนโยบายการเงินคลี่คลาย และคาดว่าเฟดจะพูดถึงความแข็งแกร่งของระบบธนาคาร ความเสี่ยงต่างๆ และปัญหาของธนาคารน่าจะสกัดได้ ดังนั้น แนะนำให้ลงทุนช่วงก่อนประชุมเฟดเพราะมองโอกาสตลาดจะรับข้อมูลทางบวกและจะทำให้ตลาดดีขึ้น ให้แนวรับ 1,540 จุด แนวต้าน 1,565-1,570 จุด</p>\n",
